**We use Weblate to translate the website, the API and the Discord bot.** If you've used Crowdin before, the process is very similar.

  You **need** an account to contribute to translations. You can sign up quickly using your Google account.

To start translating, go to [the Weblate instance](https://translate.miwa.lol/projects/miwa/), select the language you wish to translate and start translating!

## Important Notes

Some strings include special characters such as `%s`, `{something}`, or other placeholders.
These parts **must NOT** be translated, as they are automatically replaced with values in the code.
