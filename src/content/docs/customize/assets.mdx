Miwa.lol allows you to add various assets to customize your page. You can set a custom background, add a profile picture, and more to make your page unique.

## Background

**You can set a custom background for your page, which can be an image, video, or a solid color.**

- **Image**: You can upload an image file to use as your background. Supported formats include popular image formats such as PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WEBP.
- **Video**: You can upload a video file to use as your background. Supported formats include MP4 (recommended) and WebM.

  <Aside type="note">
    If you have audios uploaded on your page, the video background will be muted to avoid overlapping sounds.

- **Color**: You can choose a solid color as your background. You can either select a color from the color picker or enter a hex code. See the page below to learn more about customizing colors.

## Avatar

## Custom cursor

Due to browser restrictions, the cursor image must be no larger than 50x50 pixels, otherwise it doesn't show at all. We do not and cannot control this behavior.

## Audio

**You can add audio files to your page for an enhanced visitor experience.** By default, you can add up to 2 audio files. Premium users can add up to 8 audio files.

  To optimize our storage and ensure fast loading times, we automatically convert all uploaded audio files to the `mp3` format.
