You can customize how your page tab appears in visitors' browsers.

## Options

### Use your avatar

If enabled, your avatar will replace the default Miwa.lol logo as the tab favicon.

### Animated title

If enabled, your page title (`@username`) will be animated in the tab. You can choose from several animations for your page title in the tab:
* **None**: No animation.
* **Typewriter**: The title will appear as if typed by a typewriter.
* **Reverse**: The title will alternate between `@username` and `@emanresu`.
* **Left/Right**: The title will move back and forth horizontally.
