**Templates are pre-designed layouts and styles that you can apply to your profile to quickly change its appearance.** They provide a convenient way to customize your profile without having to manually adjust each setting.

<Aside type="caution">
  Applying a template will override your current customization settings, including themes, layouts, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of your profile.

To apply a template, simply navigate to the "Templates" section in the dashboard sidebar, browse through the available templates, and select the one you like. Once you apply a template, you can further customize it to suit your preferences.

## Free vs Premium Templates

**Some templates are available for free, while others are exclusive to Premium users.** What makes a template Premium is the options used in it. If a template uses any Premium-only options, it will be marked as Premium.
