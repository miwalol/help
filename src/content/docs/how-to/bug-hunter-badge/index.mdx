**The Bug Hunter badge is a special recognition for users who actively report bugs and issues in Miwa.lol.**

## How to earn the badge

To earn the Bug Hunter badge, you need to report bugs or issues that you find while using Miwa.lol.
Of course, it's not that simple, you need to report bugs that are not already known or reported by other users.

## Bug Reporting Guidelines

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  We want to ensure that the Bug Hunter badge is awarded for significant contributions to improving Miwa.lol, **and not just to get the badge by reporting minor issues**.
</Aside>

Those types of bugs are **NOT** considered valid for the Bug Hunter badge:
- **Already known bugs:** If the bug has already been reported by another user, or is already known to the Miwa.lol team, it does not count towards the Bug Hunter badge.
- **Typos or grammar mistakes:** While these are "issues," they do not qualify as bugs for the Bug Hunter badge because they do not affect the functionality of the platform.

For a bug to be easily verifiable, it should:
- **Be reproducible:** The bug should be something that can be consistently reproduced by the Miwa.lol team.
- **Have a clear description:** The bug report should include a clear and concise description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant screenshots or screen recordings.

## Reporting Bugs

The preferred way to report bugs is to use our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/miwa) in the dedicated forum channel. If you don't have Discord, you can also report bugs on our [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/miwalol/discussions).
