  2. Click the <ThumbsUp /> icon in the bottom right corner of the profile card.

## Leaderboard

The [leaderboard](/getting-started/leaderboard), by default, shows the most liked profiles. This is a great way to discover new profiles and see what others are enjoying.

<Aside type="tip">
  This is also a great way to get your profile noticed by others. **The more likes you have, the higher you will appear on the leaderboard!**
