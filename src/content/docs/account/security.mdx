At Miwa.lol, we take your security seriously. We have implemented several features to help you keep your account safe and secure.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security for your Miwa.lol account.
When you log in, you will be asked to enter a code generated by an authentication app (such as *Google Authenticator* or *Authy*) in addition to your password. This code is time-sensitive and changes every 30 seconds, making it difficult for anyone to access your account without your permission.

**To enable 2FA, go to your [security settings](https://miwa.lol/dashboard/settings/security) and switch the "Two-factor authentication" option.**

## Changing your password

**If you want to change your password, you can do so in your [security settings](https://miwa.lol/dashboard/settings/security).** You will need to enter your current password and then your new password to confirm the change.

  This will log you out of all your sessions, except the one you are currently using.

To protect your account, we recommend using a strong password that is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid using easily guessable information, such as your name or birthdate.
We also recommend using a password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords securely, such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) or [1Password](https://1password.com).

## Forgot your password?

**If you forget your password, you can reset it by clicking the "Forgot password?" link on the login page.**
You will receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password.

If you do not receive the email, please check your spam folder or [contact our support team](/misc/contact) for assistance.
