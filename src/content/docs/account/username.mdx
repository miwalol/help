Your username is what lets others access your Miwa.lol profile at *`https://miwa.lol/username`* (where *username* is replaced by your actual username). It can only contain letters, numbers, and most common special characters such as `-`, `_`, `.`. It cannot contain spaces or emojis.

**Your username must be unique:** if someone else has already taken it, youâ€™ll need to choose a different one.

## Choosing a username

When you register, you will be asked to choose a username. You can change your username whenever in your [account settings](https://miwa.lol/dashboard/settings). When choosing a username, keep in mind the following:
- It should be easy to remember and type.
- Often, it is best to use a name that is related to your content or brand.
- Avoid using special characters or numbers that are difficult to remember.

## Display name

By default, your display name is the same as your username. You can change your display name independently of your username.

Compared to the username, the display name is **not unique** and can contain any characters, including emojis, spaces, and special characters.
It is displayed on your profile and in the leaderboard.

<Aside type="tip">
  We recommend using your name or a nickname as your display name, as it makes it easier for others to recognize you.

## Alias <Badge text="Premium feature" variant="note" />

An alias is a second username that you can use to access your profile. For example, if your username is `miwa`, you can set an alias of `miwa2`.
When you do this, your profile will still be accessible at *`https://miwa.lol/miwa`*, but *`https://miwa.lol/miwa2`* will redirect to *`https://miwa.lol/miwa`*.

<Aside type="tip">
  This is useful if you want to change your username but still want to keep your old one accessible without complexity.
