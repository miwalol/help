Suppose you own "example.com" and want your Miwa.lol profile to show up there. When you visit "example.com", it will display your Miwa.lol profile. This page explains how to set up a custom domain for your account. No worries, it's relatively simple.

<Aside type="caution">
  Even though you can set up a custom domain, your Miwa.lol profile will still be accessible at *`https://miwa.lol/username`* (where *username* is replaced by your actual username).

## What you need

* A domain name (obviously, this guide won't help much without one!)<br></br>
  You can buy a domain from various registrars, such as [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) or [Cloudflare Registrar](https://domains.cloudflare.com/).
* Full access to your domainâ€™s DNS records

## Setting up your custom domain

First, go to your [account settings](https://miwa.lol/dashboard/settings) and click on the <Plus /> icon in the "Custom domain" field:

A dialog will appear, prompting you to enter your custom domain. Type in your domain name (e.g., "example.com"), add the CNAME record to your DNS settings, and click "Verify".

<Aside type="note">
  Depending on your DNS provider, it may take a few minutes to a few hours for the changes to propagate. If you see an error message or a blank page, please wait a bit and try again.
