---

Our API is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your applications. Here are some guidelines and best practices to help you get started:

## Making Requests

All API requests should be made to the base URL: `https://miwa.lol/api`. You can use any HTTP client to make requests, such as `curl`, Insomnia, or libraries like `python-requests` or `fetch`.

## Authentication

All API requests must include your API key in the request headers. You can find your API key in your account settings.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage of our API, we enforce rate limits on the number of requests you can make. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
