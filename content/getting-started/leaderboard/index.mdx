**Miwa.lol has a leaderboard, accessible at https://miwa.lol/leaderboard, that ranks users based on their views and likes.** By default, the leaderboard is sorted by likes (most likes first), but you can also sort it by views.

## Finding your position

Actually, there isn't another way to see your position in the leaderboard other than going to the leaderboard page and going from page to page until you find yourself. We know this is not the best way to do it, but we are working on a better solution!

## I'm not in the leaderboard, why?

**If you are not in the leaderboard, it means that you have not received any likes or views yet.** The leaderboard is updated every 15 minutes, so if you have just started using Miwa.lol, it may take some time for your profile to appear in the leaderboard.

If you have Premium, you probably chose to hide your views or likes.

## I don't want to be in the leaderboard <Badge text="Requires Premium" variant="note" />

**If you don't want to be in the leaderboard, you can hide your views and likes in <u>Customize > Privacy</u>.** This will hide your views and likes from other users and the leaderboard, but you will still be able to see your own views and likes.
