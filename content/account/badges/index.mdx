You have probably seen badges on a profile page, and maybe you asked yourself what they are.
In this page, we will explain what badges are, their purpose, types, and how to earn them.

## Common Badges

### Premium Badge

**This badge is given to users who have purchased [Miwa.lol Premium](/getting-started/pricing).**
It is a way to show that you have access to Premium features.

### Translator Badge

**This badge is given to users who have translated Miwa.lol to their language, or contributed to translations in any way.**
To get this badge, you need to have translated a good amount of text. Once you think you have done enough, you can ask for the badge in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/miwa) by opening a ticket.

<Aside type="tip">
  To contribute to translations, you can join our Crowdin project here: https://crowdin.com/project/miwa.
  It's totally free.
