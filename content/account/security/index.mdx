**We have implemented several features to help you keep your account safe and secure.**

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**2FA is an extra layer of security for your Miwa.lol account.**
When you log in, you will be asked to enter a code generated by an authentication app (such as *Google Authenticator* or *Authy*) in addition to your password. This code is time-sensitive and changes every 30 seconds, making it difficult for anyone to access your account without your permission.

**To enable 2FA, go to your [security settings](https://miwa.lol/dashboard/settings/security) and switch the *Two-factor authentication* option.**

**You can also add passkeys to your account, see this page:**

## Changing your password

**If you want to change your password, you can do so in your [security settings](https://miwa.lol/dashboard/settings/security).** You will need to enter your current password and then your new password to confirm the change.

To protect your account, we recommend **using a strong password that is at least 12 characters long**, and **includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols**.
Avoid using easily guessable information, such as your name or birthdate.

We also recommend using a password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords securely, such as your OS's one, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) or [1Password](https://1password.com).

## Forgot your password?

**If you forget your password, you can reset it by clicking the "Forgot password?" link on the login page.**
You will receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password.

If you do not receive the email, please check your spam folder or [contact our support team](/misc/contact) for assistance.
