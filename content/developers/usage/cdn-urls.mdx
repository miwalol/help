description: Learn how our CDN URL structure works and how to use it effectively.

**To deliver images, videos, etc., Miwa.lol uses a Content Delivery Network (CDN).** This ensures that content is delivered quickly and efficiently to users around the world.
To make the files structured and accessible, we use a specific URL format.

In the most cases, you won't need to construct these URLs manually, as they are provided by our API when you request user data or other resources.
However, this is not always the case, such as when we only provide the resource ID.

## URL Structure

The general format for accessing files via our CDN is as follows:

```
https://cdn.miwa.lol/{type}/{filename}.{extension}
```

### Parameters

- `{type}`: Indicates the type of asset you are accessing. See below for more details.
- `{filename}`: Unique identifier for the file, typically a UUID.
- `{extension}`: Indicates the file format.
