**To start building with Miwa.lol's API, you'll need to create an API key. Follow these steps to generate your key:**

<Steps>
  1. Log in to your Miwa.lol account: you obviously need an account to create an API key.

  2. Go to your [**Dashboard > Settings > Security**](https://miwa.lol/dashboard/settings/security). You'll find an option to create your API key there.
     If you already have an API key, it will be displayed on this page.

  3. Click on **Generate API Key**. A new API key will be generated for you.

  4. Copy your API key and store it securely. You will need this key to authenticate your requests to the Miwa.lol API.
</Steps>

<Aside type="danger" title="Important">
  Keep your API key private and do not share it with anyone. If you believe your API key has been compromised, you can regenerate it from the same settings page.
