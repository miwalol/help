## Options

### Hide views

When enabled, the view counter will be hidden on your page, as well as on the leaderboard.

### Hide badges

When enabled, your badges will not be visible on your page or on the leaderboard.

#### Hiding specific badges

You can choose to hide specific badges by going to the [Badges](https://miwa.lol/dashboard/badges) page and toggling the visibility of each badge individually.

### Hide likes

When enabled, the like button and like count will be hidden on your page, as well as on the leaderboard.

### Hide join date

When enabled, the date you joined Miwa.lol will be hidden on your page.

### Search engine indexing

When enabled, your page will be indexed by search engines such as Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. This will make it easier for people to find your page through search engines.

<Aside type="info">
  It may take some time for search engines to update their indexes after you enable this option, and unfortunately, we cannot speed up this process. Updates can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.
